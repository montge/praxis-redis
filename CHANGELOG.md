All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-26

### Added

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 39 tests across three layers:
  - 12 unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
  - 24 integration tests (requires Redis)
  - 3 end-to-end tests (complete workflows)
- **92.38% code coverage** on new modular Redis client
- **pytest configuration** with markers for test types (unit, integration, e2e, requires_redis, slow)
- **Coverage reporting** with HTML, XML, and terminal output
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** with:
  - Lint job (black, ruff, mypy)
  - Separate jobs for unit, integration, and e2e tests
  - Combined test job with full coverage reporting
  - Codecov integration for coverage tracking

#### Code Architecture
- **Modular Redis client library** (`scripts/redis_client.py`):
  - `RedisConfig`: Configuration management with environment variable support
  - `RedisStackClient`: High-level client for Redis, RediSearch, and RedisJSON
  - `RedisSearchHelper`: Utilities for RediSearch schemas and test data
  - `RedisJSONHelper`: Utilities for RedisJSON test data
  - Self-documenting code with type hints and docstrings
  - Context manager support for resource cleanup
  - Dependency injection for testability

#### Development Tools
- **Makefile** with commands for:
  - Installation (install, install-dev)
  - Redis management (start, stop, restart)
  - Testing (test, test-unit, test-integration, test-e2e, test-all, coverage)
  - Code quality (lint, format, verify, ci-local)
  - Cleanup (clean)
- **pyproject.toml** with tool configurations for black, ruff, mypy, coverage
- **requirements-dev.txt** for development-only dependencies
- **pre-commit support** (optional)

#### Documentation
- **TESTING.md**: Comprehensive testing guide
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with testing workflow, TDD approach, and development standards
- **README.md**: Updated with testing section and quick commands
- **.gitignore**: Updated with test cache directories

### Changed

#### Docker Configuration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` with:
  - Version 3.8 specification
  - Health check for Redis container
  - Dedicated network (redis-network)
  - Better container lifecycle management

#### Dependencies
- **redis** upgraded from >=4.6.0 to >=5.2.0 (latest with full Stack support)
- **python-dotenv** upgraded to >=1.0.1
- Added testing dependencies:
  - pytest >=8.3.0
  - pytest-cov >=6.0.0
  - pytest-asyncio >=0.24.0
  - pytest-timeout >=2.3.1
  - pytest-mock >=3.14.0
- Added code quality tools:
  - black >=24.10.0
  - ruff >=0.7.0
  - mypy >=1.13.0
- Added development tools:
  - ipython >=8.30.0
  - pytest-xdist >=3.6.1
  - pytest-benchmark >=4.0.0

### Technical Details

#### Test Coverage by Module
- `scripts/redis_client.py`: 92.38% coverage
  - Missing: Error handling edge cases (lines 36, 44-45, 80-81)
  - Branch coverage: 75% (9/12 branches)

#### Test Execution Performance
- Unit tests: ~0.13s (12 tests)
- Integration tests: ~0.32s (24 tests)
- End-to-end tests: ~0.30s (3 tests)
- Full suite: ~0.49s (39 tests)

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Runs on: Ubuntu latest
- Python version: 3.12
- Redis Stack: latest (with RediSearch and RedisJSON)
- All jobs use pip caching for faster execution
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov (when available)

### Migration Notes

#### For Existing Users
1. Install new dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Existing scripts (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`) remain unchanged
3. Legacy `test_redis_connection.py` still works but is marked as legacy
4. New modular client can be imported: `from scripts.redis_client import RedisStackClient`

#### Breaking Changes
None - all existing functionality is preserved

#### Recommended Workflow
1. Use `make` commands instead of direct script calls
2. Run `make test-unit` frequently during development
3. Run `make verify` before committing
4. Use `make ci-local` to simulate CI pipeline locally
